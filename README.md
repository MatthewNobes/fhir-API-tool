# FHIR API Tool

This tool acts as a middle-man for FHIR server queries, it adds the CORS headers to each request, allowing the data to be displayed in front-end web applications.

This was created as part of the FHIR-CQL project, for more details: coming soon!

## Setup

To set this file up, you need to create a .env file with the following parameters:

- ID_TOKEN
- API_URL
- X_API_KEY
